# DIO Project Challenge - Hero Level Sorter

This repository is a "Project Challenge" of the bootcamp "Potência Tech iFood - Programação do Zero" promoted by the courses and bootcamps website Digital Innovation One (DIO) with the aim of enabling students of this bootcamp to have a solid foundation in Programming Logic.

Regardless of the area of activity that a programmer will pursue, it is necessary to learn Programming Logic even if the programmer already programs in a Programming Language such as C, Java, Python, etc, since Programming Logic will reinforce its base.

The idea of this challenge is to create a program, no matter the programming language (I picked Java for this challenge), where the user inserts the name and the Experience (XP) of a Hero and the program displays the name and the XP of the hero in a pop-up window.

## Prerequisites for running the project
- JDK 8+ (I'm using JDK 17)
- IDE for Java development (I'm using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition version 2023.3.1)
